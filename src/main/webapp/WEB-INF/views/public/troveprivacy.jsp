            <h3>Trove Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>Last Updated: June 9th, 2015</p>
            <br></br>
            <h4>Privacy Policy Overview</h4>
            <p>Protecting your privacy is very important to us. For that reason, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use and disclose information that we receive when you use any of our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services, content or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.</p>
            <p>Please take the time to read through this Privacy Policy to get acquainted with our practices. By using our Services you acknowledge that the terms of this Privacy Policy will apply to you. Also, please note that we sometime use capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy. If a capitalized term is not defined in this Privacy Policy (“Services” is a good example), then that term is defined in our Terms of Service.</p>
            <h4>Revisions to Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do so, we’ll post the revised Privacy Policy on the Services, update the “Last Updated’ date above, and notify you by sending you an email or other notification. We encourage you to check this Privacy Policy on a regular basis because the revised version of the Privacy Policy will be effective and apply to your use of the Services as of the date we post it to the Services, even if you have not received separate notification from us.  You acknowledge and agree that your continued use of the Services after we have posted a revised version of the Privacy Policy to the Services will indicate your acceptance of its terms.</p>
            <h4>Collection and Used of Information</h4>
            <p><b>Account Information.</b> If you create an Account, we may collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number(s) and credit card number(s) (“PII”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth, zip code and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you. We don’t receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts. </p>
            <h5>Technical Usage-related Information.</h5>
            <p><b>Cookies.</b>  Like many website owners, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information. “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p>
            <p><b>Web Beacons.</b>  Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs or) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p>
            <p><b>Log Data.</b> Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p>
            <p><b>Location Information.</b> In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. </p>
            <br></br>
            <h4>Information Sharing and Disclosure </h4>
            <h5>What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</h5>
            <p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:</p>
            <p><u>Information Shared with Our Services Providers.</u> We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.</p>
            <p><u>Information Shared with Third Parties.</u> We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p>
            <p><u>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.</u> Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>
            <p><u>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.</u> We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
            <p><u>Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request.</u> We will share your PII with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.</p>
            <b>Do Not Track</b>
            <p>We do not track our users across third party websites and we do not currently have the capability to recognize or respond to Do Not Track signals from various web browsers. Depending on your browser and mobile device, you may be able to control tracking technologies by managing your settings.</p>
            <h5>The Security of Your Information</h5>
            <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
            <h5>Links to Other Sites</h5>
            <p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party's privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p>
            <h5>Modifying Your Information</h5>
            <p>You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by editing your information in your Account Settings. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at hello@troveup.com with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>
            <h5>International Transfer</h5>
            <p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</p>
            <h5>Our Policy Toward Children</h5>
            <p>Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under the age of 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.</p>
            <p><b>Questions?</b></p>
            <p>Please contact us at hello@troveup.com if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy.</p>
